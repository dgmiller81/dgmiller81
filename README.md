- 👋 Hi, I’m @dgmiller81 (Dallas)
- 👀 I’m interested in developing some automation scripts for random things (Stock screener, automation of daily tasks, sports, etc.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning stock tickers/screeners and other auotmation efforts.   Also been playing with the PinePhone and getting linux (Mobian) running with waydroid. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that sparks an interest.
- 📫 Reach me on here.
