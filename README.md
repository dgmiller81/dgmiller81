- Hi, I’m @dgmiller81 (Dallas)
- I’m interested in developing some automation scripts for random things (Stock screener, automation of daily tasks, sports, etc.)
- I’m currently learning stock tickers/screeners and other auotmation efforts.   Also been playing with the PinePhone and getting linux (Mobian) running with waydroid. 
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that sparks an interest.
